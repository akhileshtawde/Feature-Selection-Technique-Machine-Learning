# Feature-Selection-Technique-Machine-Learning
Feature Selection is one of the core concepts in machine learning which hugely impacts the performance of your model

How to select features and what are Benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data?

Reduces Overfitting: 
Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.

Improves Accuracy: 
Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.

Reduces Training Time: 
fewer data points reduce algorithm complexity and algorithms train faster.
